            <strong><em>What personal data do we collect and for what purpose? </em></strong>
            There are two different ways how your personal data might be collected and stored on our systems. There is the data that
            you simply tell us by entering it as part of using our application, e.g. when you write down an idea. We don't use or even
            read this data for internal purposes. It only gets stored because it is part of our service to do so.
            Other data that we collect have a purely technical nature, such as your Internet Protocol Address (IP address), browser
            type, time of your visit. We collect this data automatically when you visit our website. We store this data to ensure that
            we can appropriately react to cyber attacks and ensure the functioning of this website. Some data is being analyzed to 
            optimize the content of our website. If we do so, we anonymize the data beforehand and do not draw any conclusions about
            your personal identity.
            What about cookies?
            Simple answer: We don't use any cookies.
            </p>

           <h3 id="General-Obli"> 3. General Obligatory Information</h3>
           <p>

            data shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific
            data protection regulations applicable. By means of this data protection declaration, we would like to inform the general

            informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.
            We have implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data
            processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute
            protection may not be guaranteed.
